Project 1: Data Dependency

For this project, we analyze the data dependencies between simple instructions through two algorithms. The instruction and blocks will only have variables whose names are single letters of the English alphabet, arithmetic operators, open and close parentheses, and the assignment operator. There will be a space between each of those variables. The instruction must have at least three distinct variables. The first algorithm will identify which block can be executed parallel to the instruction. The second algorithm will identify all the pairs of instructions that can be executed in parallel.
