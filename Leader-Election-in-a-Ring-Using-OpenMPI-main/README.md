Leaders election in a ring

For this project, we implemented the concurrent two leader election algorithm to solve the leader election problem in a ring. Each process in the distributed system generates a unique ID which determines the president and vice president. In the end, the president is the process that generated the smallest even ID and the vice president is the process that generated the largest odd ID.
